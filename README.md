* _App crashes with "bad" zip code._

UX bugs
* _Wish List needs its own layout to distinguish it from the suggested bike gear list._

* _User who is authenticated should not see links to log in or create an account. (I want unauthed users to have access to basic functionality.)_

## Future Development

* _Different lists for different weather params for bike gear suggestions_
