## Known Bugs

Functional bugs

* _Wish list includes 'play' arrows that suggest they are clickable, but are not._

UX bugs
* _Users don't exactly know what the app does so, let's work on copy!_
* _If a Wish List has no items in it, the user is presented with a blank screen, womp womp._
* _Since it takes a minute for the login or the API to load weather data, the user should know their info is on the way._

## Future Development
