### Future Development

* _Use zip code to search weather data, instead of lat/long._
* _Different lists for different weather params for bike gear suggestions_
* _About Warm Up section_
* _Pick a time to bike this day, and return that hourly forecast, and the bike gear suggestions for that hour._
* _Be able to pick multiple times throughout the day, save the gear suggestions, and remove duplicate suggestions from the list._
* _Create user profiles that save their location_
* _Gear items can be saved to a list they want to find/purchase. (CRUD that list.)_
* _Gear items in the purchase list show links and phone numbers to Next Adventure/REI/Other gear shops._
